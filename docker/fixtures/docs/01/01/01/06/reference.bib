@article{Almeida2010,
abstract = {Advanced additive techniques are now being developed to fabricate scaffolds with controlled architecture for tissue engineering. These techniques combine computer-aided design (CAD) with computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) tools to produce three-dimensional structures layer by layer in a multitude of materials. Actual prediction of the effective mechanical properties of scaffolds produced by additive technologies, is very important for tissue engineering applications. A novel computer based technique for scaffold design is topological optimisation. Topological optimisation is a form of "shape" optimisation, usually referred to as "layout" optimisation. The goal of topological optimisation is to find the best use of material for a body that is subjected to either a single load or a multiple load distribution. This paper proposes a topological optimisation scheme in order to obtain the ideal topological architectures of scaffolds, maximising its mechanical behaviour.},

@article{Pan2005,
abstract = {Laser aided deposition process offers the ability to make a metal component directly from CAD drawings. Analysis of metallic powder flow in the feeding system is of particular significance to researchers in order to optimize this technique. Powder flow simulation holds a critical role in understanding flow phenomenon so as to ensure proper design and sound functionality of the coaxial nozzle. Numerical study of metallic powder flow in the coaxial nozzle for laser aided deposition is, however, barely existent. This is partially because not all of gas-atomized powders and none of water-atomised powders can be considered spheres and an accurate and economic modeling approach in describing non-spherical powder dispersion behavior can rarely be seen. To quickly simulate realistic powder flow and also meet the practical requirement for design optimization of the coaxial nozzle, a stochastic model, which considers particle shape effects, is developed. The validity of the model is demonstrated through comparison with experiment. The application of the model to the evaluation of various nozzle geometrical configurations is shown.},

abstract = {Restoration of segmental defects in long bones remains a challenging task in orthopedic surgery. Although autologous bone is still the ‘Gold Standard’ because of its high biocompatibility, it has nevertheless been associated with several disadvantages. Consequently, artificial materials, such as calcium phosphate and titanium, have been considered for the treatment of bone defects. In the present study, the mechanical properties of three different scaffold designs were investigated. The scaffolds were made of titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V), fabricated by means of an additive manufacturing process with defined pore geometry and porosities of approximately 70\%. Two scaffolds exhibited rectangular struts, orientated in the direction of loading. The struts for the third scaffold were orientated diagonal to the load direction, and featured a circular cross-section. Material properties were calculated from stress-strain relationships under axial compression testing. In vitro cell testing was undertaken with human osteoblasts on scaffolds fabricated using the same manufacturing process. Although the scaffolds exhibited different strut geometry, the mechanical properties of ultimate compressive strength were similar (145–164 MPa) and in the range of human cortical bone. Test results for elastic modulus revealed values between 3.7 and 6.7 GPa. In vitro testing demonstrated proliferation and spreading of bone cells on the scaffold surface.},

abstract = {This paper gives an overview of the issues and opportunities for the application of topology optimization methods for additive manufacturing (AM). The main analysis issues discussed are: how to achieve the maximum geometric resolution to allow the fine features easily manufacturable by AM to be represented in the optimization model; the manufacturing constraints to be considered, and the workflow modifications required to handle the geometric complexity in the post optimization stages. The main manufacturing issues discussed are the potential for realizing intermediate density regions, in the case of the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) approach, the use of small scale lattice structures, the use of multiple material AM processes, and an approach to including support structure requirement as a manufacturing constraint.

abstract = {Purpose – To propose a method to manufacture a hybrid rapid tool (a multi component tool). Design/methodology/approach – The part is decomposed into multi component prototype instead of a part made from a single piece. First, this method is based on a topological analysis of the tool. Features are regrouped starting from the numerical definition of the die. Second, the manufacturing possibilities of the high speed milling (HSM), direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) and electro discharge machining (EDM) process are analyzed. Finally this information is synthesized to obtain solutions. This method is validated by industrial example. Findings – A method is proposed to choose the best manufacturing process in order to optimize the manufacture of a “hybrid rapid tooling” between three processes: HSM, DMLS and EDM. So, it is possible to obtain the different components of the hybrid rapid tooling according to the envisaged process. Research limitations/implications – The final goal is to propose a software assistant used in association with CAD system during the design of hybrid rapid tooling. An important work concerning the features recognition must be implemented. The assembly of the different parts of the hybrid rapid tooling must be considered and optimized. Practical implications – This method allows the selection of the best process among EDM, HSM and DMLS technologies form manufacturing tools. Originality/value – The analysis of manufacturing hybrid rapid tooling has not been studied yet.},

abstract = {The microstructure and mechanical behavior of simple product geometries produced by layered manufacturing using the electron beam melting (EBM) process and the selective laser melting (SLM) process are compared with those characteristic of conventional wrought and cast products of Ti-6Al-4V. Microstructures are characterized utilizing optical metallography (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and included alpha (hcp), beta (bcc) and alpha(') (hcp) martensite phase regimes which give rise to hardness variations ranging from HRC 37 to 57 and tensile strengths ranging from 0.9 to 1.45 GPa. The advantages and disadvantages of layered manufacturing utilizing initial powders in custom building of biomedical components by EBM and SLM in contrast to conventional manufacturing from Ti-6Al-4V wrought bar stock are discussed.},

abstract = {A standardized test part can be used to quantitatively evaluate the performance of a machine or process. This document reviews existing test artifacts used to characterize additive manufacturing processes that are reported in the literature. Several aspects of the test artifacts and their use for performance characterization are discussed, including the purposes of the studies, important features found in various test pieces, and characteristics that are desirable in test pieces. The works were divided into four categories: test artifacts for comparing processes for decision making, test artifacts for evaluating individual processes, test artifacts for evaluating metal-based processes, and test artifacts for other uses. Many of the test parts have similar characteristics because research typically builds upon the findings of previous research, and many researchers may have been influenced by ?rules? put forth in earlier works. Most of the test artifact designs have various ?real? features atop a square or rectangular base. The main alternative to the square-base, multiple-feature artifacts appears to be a smaller, simpler artifact that is built at multiple positions and/or multiple orientations throughout the work volume. The proposed test parts were as large as 240 mm x 240 mm in lateral dimensions and contained features as small as 0.2 mm in dimension.},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to propose a methodology to estimate manufacturing complexity for both machining and layered manufacturing. The goal is to take into account manufacturing constraints at design stage in order to realize tools (dies and molds) by a combination of a subtractive process (high-speed machining) and an additive process (selective laser sintering). Design/methodology/approach – Manufacturability indexes are defined and calculated from the tool computer-aided design (CAD) model, according to geometric, material and specification information. The indexes are divided into two categories: global and local. For local indexes, a decomposition of the tool CAD model is used, based on an octree decomposition algorithm and a map of manufacturing complexity is obtained. Findings – The manufacturability indexes values provide a well-detailed view of which areas of the tool may advantageously be machined or manufactured by an additive process. Originality/value – Nowadays, layered manufacturing processes are coming to maturity, but there is still no way to compare these new processes with traditional ones (like machining) at the early design stage. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed to combine additive and subtractive processes, for tooling design and manufacturing. A manufacturability analysis is based on an octree decomposition, with calculation of manufacturing complexity indexes from the tool CAD model.},

In this context, path strategies are studied and different strategies are proposed and compared. This paper presents results for welding path strategies.

The proposition of this paper is to develop this numerical chain with classical CNC also present in machining machines and to benefit of their development possibilities.},

Design/methodology/approach – Various manufacturing parameters have been tested on three rapid prototyping systems: Thermojet (3DS), FDM 3000 (Stratasys) and EOSINT M250 Xtended (EOS). The objective is to select sets of parameters for reduction of electrical energy consumption. For this, a part is manufactured in several orientations and positions in the chamber of these RP systems. For each test, the electrical power is noted. Finally, certain rules are proposed to minimize this electrical energy consumption during a job. Findings – It is important to minimize the manufacturing time but there is no general rule for optimization of electrical energy consumption. Each RP system must be tested with energy consumption considerations under the spotlight. Research limitations/implications – The work is only based on rapid prototyping processes. The objective is to take into consideration the complete life-cycle of a rapid prototyped part: manufacturing of raw material as far as reprocessing of waste. Practical implications – Reduction of electrical energy consumption to complete a job. Originality/value – Currently, environmental aspects are not well studied in rapid prototyping.},

Design/methodology/approach – The part is decomposed into multi component prototype instead of a part made from a single piece. First, this method is based on a topological analysis of the tool. Features are regrouped starting from the numerical definition of the die. Second, the manufacturing possibilities of the high speed milling (HSM), direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) and electro discharge machining (EDM) process are analyzed. Finally this information is synthesized to obtain solutions. This method is validated by industrial example. Findings – A method is proposed to choose the best manufacturing process in order to optimize the manufacture of a “hybrid rapid tooling” between three processes: HSM, DMLS and EDM. So, it is possible to obtain the different components of the hybrid rapid tooling according to the envisaged process. Research limitations/implications – The final goal is to propose a software assistant used in association with CAD system during the design of hybrid rapid tooling. An important work concerning the features recognition must be implemented. The assembly of the different parts of the hybrid rapid tooling must be considered and optimized. Practical implications – This method allows the selection of the best process among EDM, HSM and DMLS technologies form manufacturing tools.

abstract = {Rapid manufacturing techniques are typically either material addition or material subtraction processes. Direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) is a material addition process that enables the rapid creation of complex parts via laser sintering (or electron beam melting) whereby layers of powder are deposited and then partially or totally melted using a laser. This technique is directly challenging other more rapid, but subtractive manufacturing processes like high-speed milling (HSM) and electro-erosion. In terms of machining, the capacity of rapid tooling to quickly manu- facture complex shapes, like conformal cooling channels, is an advantage (Boillat in J Phys IV 12(Pr 11):27–38, 2002, Au in Int J Adv Manuf Technol 34:496–515, 2007). On the other hand, the dimensional accuracy of this process is defi- nitely lower than that obtained using HSM. To our knowl- edge, no systematic study of the dimensional capacities of this process has yet been carried out. In this article, through the geometrical study of the quality of the obtained parts, the capability of this process is studied and verified with respect to the required constraints of the die casting method.},

abstract = {The metal layered manufacturing processes produce net shape metal components by fusion of metal alloys in powder or wire form. The field of those processes has grown in past years and now offers a great potential. On the one hand, reliability of powder bed processes has been improved, allowing the manufacture of fully dense parts with good accuracy. On the other hand, other approaches have been developed like direct laser metallic powder deposition or weld deposition-based rapid manufacturing. These processes allow multi-axis approaches for direct manufacturing. With these approaches, it is possible to build non-planar layers on a complex substrate. In this paper, different possibilities to manufacture direct part are analyzed. Different ways to choose substrate and the different processes used are explored. Based on this analysis, a methodology with seven steps is proposed and the first step of this method, which is a DFM approach that consists in creating customized substrate based on a CAD of the part, is presented.},

It is important to minimize the manufacturing time but there is no general rule for optimization of electrical energy consumption. Consequently, each RP system must be tested with energy consumption considerations. Our objective is to take into account the complete life-cycle of a rapid prototyped part. Various manufacturing parameters have been tested on three rapid prototyping systems. The objective is to select sets of parameters for reduction of electrical energy consumption. As a result, some rules were proposed to minimize this electrical energy consumption during a job.},

Thus, tools have to be designed, manufactured and developed at lower cost in the shortest lead-time. In this context, a methodology to optimize the manufacturing of tools, with hybrid and modular design points of view (instead of monobloc tools) is proposed. In fact, to deal with local modifications and diversifying alternatives of prod- ucts, only one or few components would have to be re-manufactured and replaced. Different manufacturing processes (additive and subtractive) are compared to choose the most suitable ones in order to optimize the overall tool manufacturing cost and lead-time. The aim is to obtain a hybrid modular decomposition of the tool that can reduce manufacturing difficulties.},

abstract = {Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM) provides manufacturing of nearly arbitrary geometries flexibly and economically. The part properties, which are reachable by state-of-the-art systems, are able to fulfill the customer requirements in terms of series and spare part production. Nevertheless, there still arise problems prohibiting the prevalent application of those techniques. The presented approach focuses on a rule-based Free-Form Deformation (FFD) for ALM. The machine is characterized by a set of rules, which is identified through observable properties extracted from precedent building processes. Adapting and applying the FFD algorithm, a pre- deformation of desired geometries based on exclusively geometric rules is achieved. Using an exclusively geometric deformation technique, CAD data is deformed before manufacturing to provide higher part quality by considering the unique characteristic of a machine.},

The main analysis issues discussed are: how to achieve the maximum geometric resolution to allow the fine features easily manufacturable by AM to be represented in the optimization model; the manufacturing constraints to be considered, and the workflow modifications required to handle the geometric complexity in the post optimization stages. The main manufacturing issues discussed are the potential for realizing intermediate density regions, in the case of the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) approach, the use of small scale lattice structures, the use of multiple material AM processes, and an approach to including support structure requirement as a manufacturing constraint.
